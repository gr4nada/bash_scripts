# SHELL BASH

## Description

Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system. The name is an acronym for the ' Bourne-Again SHell ', a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh , which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.
